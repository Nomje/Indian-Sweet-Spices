## Approach
> follow along with the Class instructions When i felt last lost i Tried just going off memory. Started with Doing some UI then working on the backend and going from there

## What Went Well
>For Honesnty reason I had the less amount of issues getting ceritan compents to render and didnt have errors up the wazo like certian methods were not working cause they are getting undefined objects and such

## Hurdles
>After Changing the favicon I went and broke my Heroku due to the uild being unale to find a favion so my application was constnly crashing 

>The issue of typos and the werid aspect of code working when typos should not make it work or causing componets from rendering there fore cause not thing to load on the page 

> I still dont understand why Proxy errors stop certian api's from comuncating with the page 

## IceBox
    
- ability to delete any of your former orders on the order History page
- Soon to implement Stock so that items can not be added if the stock in zero 
- add item descriptions so that people with allergies can get info on items to see if they are allergic to anything used to make an item
- enable a system where items will be on sale due to the weather of my Mom's Garage
